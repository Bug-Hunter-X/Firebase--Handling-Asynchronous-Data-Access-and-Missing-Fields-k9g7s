The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a field that doesn't exist in your database.  This can happen if you're not properly handling asynchronous operations or if your data structure changes unexpectedly.  For example, if you expect a field called 'username' but it's missing, you might get a 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'username')'.
