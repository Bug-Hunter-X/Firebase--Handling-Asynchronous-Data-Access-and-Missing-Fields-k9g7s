This repository demonstrates a common Firebase error related to accessing undefined fields and provides a solution. The bug.js file shows the erroneous code, attempting to access a field that might not exist. The bugSolution.js file demonstrates the improved code using optional chaining and nullish coalescing to gracefully handle missing fields.  The example involves reading data from the Firebase Realtime Database, but the principles apply to other Firebase services as well.
